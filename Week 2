#Control Flow
Control flow in Python determines the order in which statements are executed. 
Key concepts and constructs include:===
Conditional Statements (if, elif, else) for decision-making.
Loops (for and while) for repetitive tasks.
Loop control statements (break, continue, pass) for modifying loop behavior.
Exception handling (try, except, else, finally) for error handling.
Function calls (def) for code organization and reusability.
Modules and packages for code organization and reuse.
Conditional expressions (ternary operator) for concise condition-based assignments.
Use of elif for multiple conditions and meaningful indentation.

##Python Functions
Function Definition: Functions are defined using the def keyword, a name, and parentheses.
Function Call: To execute a function, call it by name with parentheses and provide arguments if needed.
Parameters and Arguments: Parameters are placeholders in the function definition, and arguments are the values passed when calling the function.
Return Statement: Functions can return values using the return statement. Multiple values can be returned as a tuple.
Default Arguments: You can assign default values to function parameters, making them optional.
Variable Scope: Variables have local scope by default within a function. Use the global keyword for global variables.
Docstrings: Document functions using triple-quoted strings at the beginning of the function definition.
Lambda Functions: Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions often used for simple operations.
Function Recursion: Functions can call themselves, useful for solving problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.
Function Overloading: Python doesn't support function overloading like some languages.
Achieve similar behavior with default arguments or variable-length arguments.
Decorators: Functions that modify or enhance the behavior of other functions, used for tasks like logging or authentication.
Function Best Practices: Give functions clear names, keep them focused, use comments and docstrings, and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.

### Introduction to Modules
Module Definition: A module is a Python file containing code, such as variables, functions, and classes.
Importing Modules: Use the import keyword to bring in the functionality of a module into your code.
Using Module Contents: Access functions, variables, and classes in a module using dot notation.
Standard Library Modules: Python includes a vast standard library of modules that cover various functionalities.
Creating Your Own Modules: Write your Python code in a .py file, and it becomes a module that can be imported into other scripts.
Module Aliases: Assign aliases to module names for more concise usage.
Importing Specific Items: Import only the specific functions, variables, or classes you need from a module.
Module Documentation: Include a docstring at the top of your module to describe its purpose and contents.
Package Structure: Modules can be organized into packages, which are directories containing multiple modules.
Relative Imports: Use relative imports to import modules or packages from the same or parent directories.
Special Module Attributes: Modules can have special attributes like __name__ for identifying whether the module is being run directly or imported.
Best Practices: Keep modules small and focused, use meaningful names, document your code, and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.

#### Regular Expressions
Regular Expressions:==Regular expressions are patterns used for text pattern matching and manipulation.
The re Module:==Python's re module provides functions and methods for working with regular expressions.
Creating Regular Expressions:==Regular expressions are constructed using special characters and metacharacters to define patterns.
Basic Matching:==re.search() finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a string and returns a match object.
Anchors:==Anchors like ^ and $ specify where in the text a pattern should match.
Character Classes:==Square brackets [] define sets of characters to match.
Quantifiers:==Quantifiers like *, +, and ? specify the repetition of the preceding element.
Escape Sequences:==Use \ to escape special characters for literal matching.
Groups and Capturing:==Parentheses () create groups and capture matched text.
Non-Capturing Groups:==(?:...) creates non-capturing groups for grouping without capturing.
Metacharacters:==Metacharacters like | and \b allow for complex pattern matching.
Flags:==Flags like re.IGNORECASE enable case-insensitive matching.
Replacement:==re.sub() replaces matched patterns in text with a specified string.
Validation and Sanitization:==Regular expressions are useful for data validation and sanitization.
Best Practices:==Regular expressions should be well-tested and understood, and raw strings are often used to avoid unintended escape sequences.
